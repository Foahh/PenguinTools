# SUS Format Specification v2.7 (rev2)

Note: **SUS** now stands for *Sliding Universal Score*, not *SeaUrchin Score*.

## 1. Overview

* It is text data composed entirely of printable characters.
* File extension: `*.sus`
* EOL: **CRLF** or **LF**
* Encoding: always **UTF-8**
* Lines beginning with `#` have meaning as data; all other lines are treated as comments and ignored.
* Parts that specify string data are quoted with `" ~ "`.

## 2. Metadata Lines

* Various commands listed below are written following `#`.
* For items marked `(ASCII)`, only ASCII characters may be used in the content.
* For items marked `(UTF-8)`, non-ASCII characters may also be used in the content.

### `#TITLE` Song title (UTF-8)

* `#TITLE "Song Title"`

### `#SUBTITLE` Song subtitle (UTF-8)

* `#SUBTITLE "Song Subtitle"`

### `#ARTIST` Song artist (UTF-8)

* `#ARTIST "Artist"`

### `#GENRE` Song genre (UTF-8)

* `#GENRE "Genre"`

### `#DESINGER` Chart designer (UTF-8)

* `#DESIGNER "Designer"`

### `#DIFFICULTY` Chart difficulty type (ASCII/UTF-8)

* Specifies the type of chart difficulty as either an integer or a string.
* For numeric values, the following five are reserved by the specification:
    * `#DIFFICULTY 0`
    * `#DIFFICULTY 1`
    * `#DIFFICULTY 2`
    * `#DIFFICULTY 3`
    * `#DIFFICULTY 4`
* It may also be specified as a string, but how that is handled depends on the application.

### `#PLAYLEVEL` Chart level (ASCII)

* Specifies the chart level as an integer.
    * `#PLAYLEVEL 10`
* A trailing `+` may also be specified.
    * `#PLAYLEVEL 14+`

### `#SONGID` Song ID (ASCII)

* How this value is handled depends on the application.
* `#SONGID "songid"`

### `#WAVE` Audio file

* Specified as a relative path from the sus file.
* Supported file formats depend on the application.
* `#WAVE "filename.wav"`

### `#WAVEOFFSET` Audio file offset

* Specifies the difference between chart playback start and audio file playback timing.
* Unit: seconds. Decimal values may be used.
* If a positive value is specified, the chart starts first.
* If a negative value is specified, the audio starts first.
* `#WAVEOFFSET 0.5`

### `#JACKET` Song jacket image

* Specified as a relative path from the sus file.
* Supported file formats depend on the application.
* `#JACKET "jacket.jpg"`

### `#BACKGROUND` Background image file

* Specified as a relative path from the sus file.
* Supported file formats depend on the application.
* `#BACKGROUND "jacket.jpg"`

### `#MOVIE` Background video file

* Specified as a relative path from the sus file.
* Supported file formats depend on the application.
* `#MOVIE "movie.mp4"`

### `#MOVIEOFFSET` Background video file offset

* Specifies the difference between chart playback start and video file playback timing.
* Unit: seconds. Decimal values may be used.
* If a positive value is specified, the chart starts first.
* If a negative value is specified, the video starts first.
* `#MOVIEOFFSET 0.5`

### `#BASEBPM` Base tempo for scroll speed calculation

* Specifies the tempo used as the basis for scroll speed calculation.
* The actual scroll speed changes as a ratio relative to this value.
* If omitted, the value of the first BPM change is used.
* `#BASEBPM 120.0`

### `#REQUEST` Special attributes

* Sends special commands to the application.
* Described later in section 4.
* `#SUBTITLE "Song Subtitle"`

## 3. Chart Data Lines

* Each line consists of a “header part”, `:`, and a “data part”.
* A `:` must be appended after the header part.
* The data part is made up of sets of 2 digits; the number of sets divides the measure, and each division represents a
  timing point.
    * For example, if `11111111` is specified, notes are placed at quarter-note intervals.
    * The maximum number of divisions depends on the application, but it should support at least 512 divisions (data
      part 1024 bytes).
    * For each 2-digit data value, the meaning of the first digit depends on the data type, but `0` always means nothing
      is placed.
    * The second digit always represents note width, where `1` to `z` indicate widths 1 to 35.
    * Therefore, positions where no note exists should be filled with `00`.

* `mmm`
    * For certain specific strings, it represents special data.
    * Otherwise, it is general data and indicates the measure number.
        * Measure numbers start from 0.
* `x`
    * Specifies the leftmost lane of the note.
    * From the left: 0, 1, 2, ..., 9, a, b, c, ...
    * Case-insensitive.
* `y`
    * Specifies the channel for the note.
    * As with `x`, `0` to `z` may be used.
    * Case-insensitive.
* `zz`
    * Specifies the number of special data.
    * Base36 values from 01 to zz may be used.

### `#mmm02` Measure length

* Specifies the measure length in beats from that measure onward.
* Decimal values may be used. However, values of the form **M / 2^n (M, n ∈ N)** are preferred.

### `#BPMzz`, `#mmm08` BPM definition / change

* Specifies the tempo from that point onward by referencing a BPM definition.
* Tempo values may be decimals.
* `#BPM01: 140.0`
* `#00008: 01`

### `#ATRzz`, `#ATTRIBUTE zz`, `#NOATTRIBUTE` Note attribute definitions

* Use ATR to define a set of note attributes.
    * Defined as a string, with multiple values separated by commas.
    * `rh:<decimal>` directional roll speed
    * `h:<decimal>` note height
    * `pr:<integer>` note rendering priority
* Writing `#ATTRIBUTE zz` applies note attribute `zz` to data from that line onward.
* Writing `#NOATTRIBUTE` removes note attributes from data from that line onward.

```text
#ATR01: "pr:100, h: 1.5"
#ATTRIBUTE 01
#00010: 14141414
#NOATTIRBUTE
```

### `#TILzz`, `#HISPEED zz`, `#NOSPEED` Speed change definitions

* Different speeds can be applied per note (hereafter called high-speed definitions).
* A high-speed definition is written as a string, with multiple values separated by commas.
    * String format: `meas'tick:speed`
    * `meas`: measure number (integer)
    * `tick`: tick (integer)  
      (A unit that further divides a measure. By default, 1 beat = 480 ticks, so 1 measure = 1920 ticks.)
    * `speed`: speed (decimal; negative values are also allowed)
* Writing `#ATTRIBUTE zz` applies high-speed definition `zz` to data from that line onward.
* Writing `#NOATTRIBUTE` removes high-speed definitions from data from that line onward.

```text
#TIL01: "0'0:1.0, 0'960:2.0"
#HISPEED 01
#00010: 14141414
#NOSPEED
```

### `#MEASUREBS` Measure number base value

* From the point where this is specified onward, the given value is always added to the measure number in data lines.
* If specified multiple times, the last specified value overwrites the previous added value.

```text
... 0-999
#MEASUREBS 1000
... 1000-1999
#MEASUREBS 2000
... 2000-2999
```

### `#MEASUREHS` Measure line speed change specification

* If the application supports displaying measure lines, this can specify speed changes for those lines.
* The value specified is the same as for `#TIL`.

```text
#MEASUREHS 01
```

### `#mmm1x` Tap

* A single note that does not move position.
* The following three are reserved by the specification:
    * `1?` Tap 1
    * `2?` Tap 2
    * `3?` Tap 3
    * `4?` Tap 4
    * `5?` Tap 5
    * `6?` Tap 6
* `#00010: 2414141434141414`

### `#mmm2xy` Hold

* A long note whose position does not move.
* The same width must be specified at all points.
* Notes with the same channel are connected.
    * `1?` Start point
    * `2?` End point
    * `3?` Relay point
* `#00020a: 14002400`

### `#mmm3xy` Slide 1

* A long note whose position moves.
* Different widths may be set for each point.
* Shape can be smoothed using Bézier curves.
* The curve shape is defined by continuous line segments connecting the centers of relay-point and control-point notes.
* Notes with the same channel are connected.
    * `1?` Start point
    * `2?` End point
    * `3?` Relay point
    * `4?` Bézier curve control point
    * `5?` Invisible relay point
* `#00030a: 14340024`

### `#mmm4xy` Slide 2

* A long note whose position moves.
* The basic specification is equivalent to Slide 1, so it is omitted here.

### `#mmm5x` Directional

* A note definition with direction.
* It does not necessarily need to overlap another note and may also be placed independently.
    * `1?` Up
    * `2?` Down
    * `3?` Upper-left
    * `4?` Upper-right
    * `5?` Lower-left
    * `6?` Lower-right
* `#00050: 14241424`

## 4. Special attributes that can be specified with `#REQUEST`

The following are defined by the specification.

### `ticks_per_beat` Change the number of ticks per beat

* `#REQUEST "ticks_per_beat <integer>`
* When using \(n\)-th notes in a chart, this should be set so that it is a divisor of measure beat count × tick count.

### `enable_priority` Enable/disable priority-based note rendering

* `#REQUEST "enable_priority true/false"`
